# 🚀 Expert in AI, ML, and Full-Stack Development with 10+ years of expertise


## Hi there 👋
As a Full Stack Engineer, I am responsible for the development and maintenance of web-based applications and systems. This includes designing and implementing user interfaces using front-end and back-end technologies as well as implementing server-side logic.

I am responsible for the development and maintenance of web-based applications and systems, including the design and implementation of user interfaces, the implementation of server-side logic, and the building and maintenance of databases. I ensure that the web applications I work on are secure, scalable, and maintainable, and I contribute to the planning and execution of new features and updates. I am adept at troubleshooting and fixing issues that arise, and I stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in web development to deliver high-quality solutions.

I am an AI developer with expertise in various technologies and platforms. I can use programming languages such as Python, and JavaScript to create conversational agents that leverage GPT-3, GPT-4, BARK AI, Dialogflow, Rasa, Wit.ai and other AI frameworks. I have a solid understanding of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing, which enables me to build AI systems that can communicate naturally and intelligently.
